            <!-- <p id="another-style">I was born in <em>October</em> 1990. <br>
                I graduated Xavier High School in Cedar Rapids back in 2009 and from there I did 2.5 years at Kirkwood Community College. <br>
                Eventually I got bored of school and decided that joining the Marines was a great idea. So I did. I joined Dec 11th 2011. Fun fact. 
                Dec 23rd 2011, I got my wisdom teeth pulled out by 2 Navy doctors who were talking about how they would spend their Christmas. <br>
                In 2014 I went and joined the Marine Security Guard program and got to spend the next 3 years overseas and different US. Embassies. <br>
                When I got out of the Marines in 2017 I started school at the University of Iowa. I graduated in Dec 2020 with a degree in 
                Social Informatics. This degree gave me a taste of programming and I am feeding my hunger to code by attending DeltaV Code School.
